# pyEDSD, beta version 0.3.3

*  Explicit Design space decomposition
    
    Parameters :
    ----------
        func : function(n-dimensional vector) -> 0 or 1, function to classify
        X0 : list of n-dimension vectors
            
                must contain at leat one point in each class
        bounds : list of 2 n-dimensionnal vector
        
        N0 : int, optional (default = 10)
        
            number of points to be added to the training set before initialising the svm
            chosen random uniformly between bounds to initialise the svm
            
        N1 : int, optional (default = 10)
        
            number of points to be added to the training set, 
            chosen near the decision function 
            
        processes : int, optional (default = 1)
        
            if processes > 1, then the commputation is paralellized, and the SVC is updated
            only after "processes" points on the boundary have been found
            
        params* : all the parameters of an SVC (cf . sklearn.svm.SVC)
    
    Returns : 
    ----------
        an svcEDSD, which is an svc to which are added 
        
        1 methods
        
            draw : function(h)
                    displayes the decision bounday together with the training sets
            volume : function()
            
            dist_from : function
            
            ...
                    
        2 objects
